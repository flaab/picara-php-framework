# Picara PHP Web Development Framework 

A PHP rapid development framework for MVC http/rest/cli applications, developed since 2007. It focuses on convention over configuration and implements implicit routing. It offers a flexible admin site from scratch, rich scaffolding and libraries for cache generation, queries, lang files, pagination, sessions, validation, forms, images, email, file uploads, static pages and more. 

PicaraPHP is fast, self-contained and has no dependencies nor middleware. It can be used to create applications with different access points: http, command-line, RestFUL API controllers and a comprehensive admin site. It uses with AdoDB as database abstraction layer.
